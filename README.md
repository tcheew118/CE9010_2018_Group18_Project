Data Science Project on Wine Quality

# Project Wine
This is a project on analyzing wine quality, to understand how different chemical components in the wine will affect its taste

## Data Acquisition of Red Wine Data from the Internet
This notebook is the first part of the Project. We separate the project into several different notebooks (in line with the project guidelines):
1. Data Acquisition ([Red Wine Data Acquisition](Wine%20Data%20Acquisition.ipynb))
2. Data Exploration ([Preprocessing](Project_Preprocess.ipynb))
3. Data Analysis and Interpretation ([Linear Regression](Project_LinReg.ipynb), [scikit-learn](Project_Sklearn.ipynb))

Click on the links of the notebook to navigate around the project in jupyter notebook.

Comments are available in the code snippets to aid in explaination.
